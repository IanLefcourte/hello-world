Introduction to Github

My name is Ian Lefcourte and I am learning the different features of Github.

The overall purpose of this Github is to grow my abilities in SQL and Python.
I have earned a Master of City and Regional Planning from Rutgers, the state university of New Jersey,
where I specialized in Environmental Planning
